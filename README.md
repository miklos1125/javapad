# javapad

This is a poor man's IDE. :)

A simple text editor. You can load, save and edit java files, compile and run them.

This is an experimenting project, it will be always under construction...  

Next stages:
1. to have a proper console
2. Classname comparisson with Filename
3. multiple classes / files in multiple windows
4. some basic kind of syntax checker
